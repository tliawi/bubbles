//  Summary of messagery:
	
//  Client starts with a nodeID of -1.
//  Client sends myNetworkClient.Connect(serverIP, CScommon.serverPort)
//  Server handles MsgType.Connect, replies with gamePhaseMsg 1 with numNodes, numLinks and worldRadius
//	Client responds with initRequestMsg including a name
//	Server replies with a suite of reliable initMsgs and updateMsgs and linkMsgs that cover the whole world.
//  During gamePhase 1, the game is paused, i.e. there is no movement or change other than clients choice of which node to mount.

//  If user clicks on a desired node to mount, client sends a requestNodeId for that node.
//	The server replies with a nodeIdMsg which either contains their old, unchanged bubble assignment
//  (which may have been -1) which indicates their request is denied for some reason, OR it contains the desired nodeId.
//  If request granted, server will issue an initRevisionMsg of the changed DNA (reflecting that the node is mounted) to all connected clients.

//  When game is launched on server, server sends gamePhaseMsg 2 to all clients, the game is unpaused, and the server
//  begins sending regular unreliable updateMsgs, and irregularly sends reliable initRevisionMsgs and linkMsgs.

//  If server starts a new game, it issues a new gamePhaseMsg 1 to all connected clients.
